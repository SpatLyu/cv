# Some stuff about me

- My research interests lie in **advancing methodologies in spatial causal inference** and **developing high-performance computational tools**, with a primary focus on *R packages*.
- Currently, my work centers on **Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM)** framework for modeling *dynamic system* and **Difference-in-Differences (DID)** methods for *event studies*. I am particularly interested in leveraging these approaches to address critical challenges in *urban sustainability*, *climate change mitigation*, and broader global issues.
- I specialize in *data analysis*, *statistical modeling*, and developing open-source analytical tools, including *R packages*, using **R**, **C++**, and **Python**, with a strong focus on *spatial analysis*. I actively contribute to the R geospatial community and am dedicated to advancing open-source geospatial software.
